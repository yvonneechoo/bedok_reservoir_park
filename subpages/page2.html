  <h2>History of Bedok Reservoir</h2>
</div>

<div class="page_2_txt_section">
  <p>Located in the eastern part of Singapore, Bedok Reservoir used to be a sand quarry. In 1983, the transformation of the sand quarry into a reservoir began under the Sungei Seletar – Bedok Water Scheme. A water treatment plant, Bedok Waterworks, was built about 400 m west of Bedok Reservoir to treat the water from Sungei Seletar Reservoir and Bedok Reservoir as part of the water scheme. Two pumping stations and 17 km of pipelines facilitated the transfer of raw water from Sungei Seletar Reservoir to Bedok Reservoir and then to the treatment plant. The latter had an initial daily treatment capacity of 136,000 cu m. 

  <p> Bedok Reservoir has a surface area of 880,000 m², and a capacity of 12.8 million m³. The mean depth of the reservoir is 9 m, with a maximum depth of 18.2m and a shoreline length of 4.3 km. <p>
  
  <p>In 2004, Bedok Reservoir opened to water sports activities such as wakeboarding, kayaking and fishing. This follows the Singapore Sports Council’s (SSC's) efforts to allow water sport enthusiasts to make use of the various reservoirs for activities which do not compromise the quality of the water. </p>
